LLM Summarization of Class Feedback
Team 8 – Energy Sector (Attack Posture)
 Course: INFO 492 B Period: Weeks 3–4 Compiled by: LLM (GPT-5) based on peer feedback forms
1 Overall Perception
Across both Experiment #1 and #2, students consistently recognized Team 8’s project as one of the most realistic and well-scoped attack simulations in the class. Peers praised the team for choosing a credible target in the Pacific Northwest energy grid and for designing an AI reconnaissance agent that mirrors nation-state APT operations. Reviewers appreciated how the team moved beyond simple automation to explore speed, scale, and cost advantages of AI while keeping a focus on Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) oversight.
Average scores (4.8–5 out of 5 for “incorporated feedback” and “stakeholder integration”) show that the class viewed the iteration between Demo #1 and Demo #2 as clear, data-driven, and responsive to feedback.
2 Key Strengths Recognized by Peers
a. Refined Human-in-the-Loop Logic
 Classmates identified the introduction of structured HIL checkpoints as the most significant improvement from the first to the second experiment. They noted that the team’s approval flow and vulnerability ranking system (1–5 scale) created a safer and more explainable attack model, addressing earlier concerns about AI autonomy and detectability.
b. Increased Realism and Scalability
 Reviewers highlighted the shift from a single wind farm target to the regional Bonneville Power Administration as a strong step toward nation-state-level realism. They noted the use of geospatial maps and critical-intersection analysis to visualize how AI reconnaissance scales across interconnected grids.
c. Integration of Stakeholder Insights
 Several students referenced the team’s inclusion of industry criteria—detection speed, precision vs. false positives, and operational risk—originally from the GridGuardian interview. Peers saw this as evidence that the team aligned academic work with industry standards.
d. Improved Presentation and Narrative Flow
 By Week 4, students found the project’s slides and storyline “much clearer and more confident.” The AI agent’s workflow was easier to follow, and the technical rationale felt more cohesive than in the initial demo.
3 Main Critiques and Risks Identified
a. High Detectability of AI Agents
 The most repeated concern was that the AI agent’s actions remained too obvious to defensive systems. Peers recommended developing a concealment metric to measure how long the AI could operate undetected after entry, and experimenting with slower data changes and adaptive timing.
b. Validation of Assumptions about Scalability
 Several students questioned whether smaller utilities like PSE and larger ones like Bonneville share the same security profiles. They suggested testing AI performance in a digital-twin environment to compare recon coverage and false-positive rates across different system types.
c. Need for Grounded Evaluation Metrics
 Consistent with Professor Martinez’s guidance, peers emphasized the importance of “grounded truth” benchmarks to validate AI results against manual methods. Students proposed building evaluation dashboards for speed, accuracy, and HIL intervention rates.
d. Ethical and Oversight Boundaries
 Classmates warned that the project’s complex automation could blur human responsibility. They supported the team’s inclusion of HIL but advised developing clear guardrails for AI decision-making and transparency.

6 Summary Statement
Class feedback confirmed that Team 8’s core hypothesis was compelling and progress between Experiments #1 and #2 was clear. Peers agreed that the AI Recon Agent demonstrated how automation could outperform humans in speed and scale, but they also pressed for more validation of accuracy and stealth. The team’s decision to add Human-in-the-Loop controls was viewed as a major ethical and technical improvement, transforming the project from a “fast AI attack” into a controlled, explainable system aligned with real-world cybersecurity practice.
